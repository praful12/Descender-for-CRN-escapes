# Descender-for-CRN-escapes
 This is a functional gradient algorithm for finding escapes in stochastic chemical reaction networks. This is written in MATLAB, using live scripts for a more interactive experience. The algorithm is described in an associated paper. If you use the code or the algorithm, please cite the paper.

## Workflow
The MATLAB live scripts are labelled in the order of the workflow, and have comments inside to follow what is being done. (The live script calls functions, which are similarly commented).  


## MATLAB version
MATLAB R2020a

## Toolboxes needed
1. Curve fitting toolbox
