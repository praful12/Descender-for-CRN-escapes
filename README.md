# Descender-for-CRN-escapes
 A functional gradient algorithm for finding escapes in stochastic chemical reaction networks. The algorithm is described in an associated paper. If you use the code or the algorithm, please cite the paper.  


## Workflow
1. Create a folder named 'Data' outside the directory which contains the code. 
2. The MATLAB live scripts are labelled in the order of the workflow, and have comments inside to follow what is being done. (The live script calls functions, which are similarly commented).  


## MATLAB version
MATLAB R2020a
